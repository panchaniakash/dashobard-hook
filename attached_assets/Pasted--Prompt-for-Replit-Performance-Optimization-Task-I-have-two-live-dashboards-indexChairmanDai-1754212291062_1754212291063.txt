üõ†Ô∏è Prompt for Replit: Performance Optimization Task

I have two live dashboards: indexChairmanDaily and indexChairmanMonthly, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Both dashboards are fully functional, but I‚Äôm currently experiencing performance issues‚Äîespecially during filter selection and chart updates. These actions cause noticeable delays in responsiveness and rendering.

üîß Task:
Please optimize the performance of the indexChairmanDaily dashboard without changing any of its core logic or functionality.

üéØ Objectives:
Make the dashboard load faster.

Improve filter responsiveness and chart rendering speed.

Ensure smoother user interactions with zero functional changes.

‚úÖ Allowed Improvements:
Use Node.js or advanced Node.js concepts for backend optimization.

Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend (no TypeScript).

Optimize performance using techniques such as:

Asynchronous data fetching

Smart caching strategies

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) if beneficial

Dynamic/lazy loading of assets (scripts/charts/data)

You may enhance chart performance using tools like Chart.js, D3.js, or similar‚Äîbut maintain the same charts and behavior.

Constraints:
Do not change or remove any existing functionality.

All grid layouts and chart positions must remain exactly the same.

If the grids are editable in the current version, they must remain editable.

Do not use TypeScript.

And the UI note section should also be updated slightly for clarity:

üìù Notes:
The UI must remain exactly the same‚Äîno visual or structural changes.

All charts and grids must look and function exactly as before.

This is strictly a performance optimization task only.

All existing interactivity (e.g., editable grids, chart interactions) must remain intact.

üì¶ I‚Äôve uploaded the full source code for the indexChairmanDaily dashboard.

Once this is successfully optimized and verified, I‚Äôll provide the code for the second dashboard (indexChairmanMonthly) for a similar performance upgrade.
